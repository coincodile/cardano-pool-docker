Metadata 
========

example <a id="metadata-example"></a>

The `examples/metadata.json` file is the file that holds metadata about your pool.

It looks like the following, and has to be upload to a host so it is accessible to the public via. an URL.
You can for example upload it as a [github gist](https://gist.github.com).

.. code-block:: json

	{
	    "name": "Example Pool",
	    "description": "Cardano stakepool example",
	    "ticker": "TEST",
	    "homepage": "https://github.com/abracadaniel/cardano-node-docker"
	}
