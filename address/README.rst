Cardano Address
===================================================================

This module provides mnemonic (backup phrase) creation, and conversion 
of a mnemonic to seed for wallet restoration, and address derivation 
functionalities.

cardano-address comes with a command-line interface for Linux. See the 
release artifacts or continuous integration artifacts to get a pre-compiled
binary, or build a Docker image. The command-line is self explanatory 
by using --help on various commands and sub-commands.
